We have years of experience with websites using a content manager. But it was time to share it and develop an open-source and self-hosted content manager.

In ActiveCMS you can implement the content management of any website. But this development focused on the creation, administration and publication of documents in scientific journals, thanks to the financing of project ID: FP200001, from the National Agency for Research and Development of Chile (ANID).

### Active CMS
With Active CMS you can:
- Define the structure and information of the content to be managed.
- Define flow for the incorporation and validation of the content to be published.
- Upload content manually or import from other sources.
- Design different web displays of content, even in different languages.
- Incorporate functionality for visitors to the website, such as registration, authentication, restrictions on access to content.
- Keep statistics of visits to the different contents.
